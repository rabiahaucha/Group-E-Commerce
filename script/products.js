And although trial-and-error can certainly help you decide what skincare product works for your skin, this can be troublesome when you consider the fact that retinol serums aren't exactly the most affordable of products to begin with. Plus, once you finally do get your hands on one that suits you, you'll need to be extra careful with how you use it so as not to damage your skin's surface.",

After all, a sun-kissed glow is a never a bad idea, especially during the summer. And considering that more often than not, the skin on our face doesn't get tanned as much as the rest of our body, it's fair to say that anyone can benefit from a bronzy boost. So whether you're simply looking to diversify your everyday look with a J-Lo-inspired glow, consider a bottle of bronzing drops your new best friend.",
